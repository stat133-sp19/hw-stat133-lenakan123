## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Kitchen Exercise 1

###Ingredients list

* 1 1/4 cups minced scallions, both green and white parts (from a 4-ounce       bundle)
* 2 tablespoons minced or finely grated fresh ginger
  + Neutral oil (such as grapeseed, safflower, or sunflower)
  + 1/4 cup sherry or rice wine vinegar
  + Fine sea salt
  + About 1 heaped cup julienned or coarsely grated carrots (from about 8 ounces   fresh)
  + 8 ounces small (Persian-style, about 2) cucumbers, thinly sliced
  + 3 cups cooked, cooled rice (my favorite here is short-grain brown or white)
  4 eggs
  + Soy sauce or tamari (to serve)
  + Toasted sesame oil (to serve)
  + Sriracha, gochujang or another hot sauce of your choice (to serve)

###Special "Tools"
* Julienne Tool 

###Recipe Steps 

* Make the vinaigrette: Mix scallions, ginger, 1/4 cup oil and sherry or rice wine vinegar in a bowl. Season with salt (I use about 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt). Set aside.
* Crisp your rice: Heat a large frying pan over medium high. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons oil; you'll want to coat the bottom with a thin layer of oil all over. Nonstick pan (as I used) are more forgiving here, so you can use the lower amount. Heat the oil until it's hot, another minute, then scatter half the rice over the surface; it's okay if small clusters remain. Season lightly with salt and do not touch it. In 3 to 5 minutes, the underside will become golden brown and crisp. Use a spatula to flip it in sections then fry on the other side until it is also crisp. Divide between two bowls and repeat with remaining rice, dividing it between two remaining bowls.
+ Crisp your egg: If there isn't enough oil left in the pan (you want a thin layer), add another splash and heat this on high heat. Add eggs one at a time and season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook until brown, lacy, and crisp underneath, and the whites are opaque, bubbly and dramatic and the edges are brown. You can spoon some oil from the pan over the egg whites to help them cook faster. Place one egg on each bowl of rice.
+ Assemble bowls: Arrange some cucumbers and carrots to each bowl. Spoon 2 tablespoons vinaigrette onto each bowls. Drizzle each egg with a half-teaspoon of tamari and toasted sesame oil, letting it roll onto the other ingredients, plus hot sauce to taste. Eat immediately. Repeat frequently.
+ Do ahead: The dressing will keep for 5 to 6 days in the fridge; the chopped vegetables will keep for 3 to 4.

###Special season for this meal

* Winter 

###Variations of this meal
* Comment by Molly Robinson: I made a variation of this for dinner last night and just wanted to say how GENIUS the rice crisping is. It makes for such a wonderful texture to contrast the toppings. Thanks for another great technique and recipe!

* Comment by Angela Tan: Are you using a regular microplane to grate the ginger, or a slight variation on same? Just wondering because whenever I try to grate ginger with my microplane I get something more like ginger pulp with ginger juice. Thanks!

##Euclidean Distance 

###Definition:
The **Euclidean distance** between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{pq}$).
In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$d(p,q)=(q,p)= \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^{2}+(q_2-p_2)^{2}+...+(q_n-p_n)^{2})}$
      $=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i-p_i)^2$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$||p||= \sqrt{p^2_1+p^2_2+...p^2_n} = \sqrt{p\cdot p}$

where the last expression involves the dot product.

Describing a vector as a directed line segment from the origin of the Euclidean space (vector tail), to a point in that space (vector tip), its length is actually the distance from its tail to its tip. The Euclidean norm of a vector is seen to be just the Euclidean distance between its tail and its tip.

The relationship between points **p** and **q** may involve a direction (for example, from **p** to **q**), so when it does, this relationship can itself be represented by a vector, given by

$q-p=(q_1-p_1, q_2-p_2,...q_n-p_n)$. 

In a two- or three-dimensional space (n = 2, 3), this can be visually represented as an arrow from p to q. In any space it can be regarded as the position of **q** relative to **p**. It may also be called a displacement vector if **p** and **q** represent two positions of some moving point.

The Euclidean distance between p and q is just the Euclidean length of this displacement vector:

$||q-p||=\sqrt{(q-p) \cdot (q-p)}.$

which is equivalent to equation 1, and also to:

$||q-p|| = \sqrt{||p||^2+||q||^2- 2p \cdot q}$
